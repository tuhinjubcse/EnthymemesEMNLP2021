In my life I've seen children and teens be much better adjusted because they've had to go through not only the normal chaos of childhood with other children calling names and being mean but they've also had to go through what I might call an orientation that very few kids have...and that is that prejudice, hatred and a lack of understanding for the human condition so thoroughly exists in this world. I've seen them build both strength and character through their upbringing. # Gay parents can adopt and ensure a happy life for a baby.

Rave, you seem to know about as much about the Healthcare Bill as you do grammar.  This bill will  decrease  the national debt by half a trillion over ten years. It's  good  for the economy.  You see, uninsured people currently only have the option of going to an emergency room when very sick. This bill insures the uninsured, meaning that hospital visit will no longer be taken care of by tax payers. Next, insured people are more likely to see a doctor, which in turn leads to people catching diseases like cancer before they are life-threatening, and before they cost hundreds of thousands to treat. Which again saves money.  Then there is the whole human life thing. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare. # Ensured better healthcare
I don't care if they dig up Moe Howard...I'd rather vote for him. # We have better republicans than Obama
Every nation that has ever passed a Healthcare plan similar to the one Obama passed was happy for it   So if everyone else is doing it we should too? Most of these countries are having financial meltdowns because of massive deficit spending. # Healthcare bill is a failure
Obama is another Hitler. There is not an ounce of capitalism or freedom in him. # Not eligible as a leader
Low expenditure. # Fixed the economy
The economy is very clearly recovering. # Fixed the economy
The simple fact is that every single one of the last presidents saw the recession coming, but no one really knew how to stop it. Now that it's here, Obama doesn't know how to fix it. # Destroyed our economy
we do not want his socialist ideals governing us. # Poor decision-maker
The president drafted up a bill, to improve the employment rate and to provide jobs, congressional Republicans voted that bill down, and yet they continue to use in their rhetoric the fact unemployment is still high as reasons we should disapprove of the President. # Created more jobs
He ignores that majority of America doesn't want Health Care but he still pushes it through. Ignorant much?  Health Care is another way of  Theft  for the government.  They take your money and give it to someone else and themselves.  Being forced to have insurance or your given a fine on your income?. # Healthcare bill is a failure
I like his policies. # Makes good decisions/policies
He has compromised even with the intransigent republicans on 50 of his promises (compared to the ONE compromise the GOP has). # Has qualities of a good leader

He has the American people's best interest at heart and I think when 2012 rolls around people will recognize that. # Has qualities of a good leader
So far I see Obama is willing to make some sacrifices, but not the tough ones. Tough ones are required to climb out of the hole which we have dug. The borrowing has to stop. The printing has to stop. Or we will never get out. # Not eligible as a leader
Obama is a lame baboon with money. # Destroyed our economy
Even many liberals are angry with him because of how many compromises he has made with the now republican house so he may not even make the nomination. # Not eligible as a leader
A Fight I'm willing to have is Obama out of his mind. Does he really want to economy to get better? Why would he say something so asinine. Then if he is going to tear apart the banks then he needs to also tear apart the Unions for making GM fail and also for Fannie and Freddie which then he would have to go after his own lobbyist and tax them as well. # Destroyed our economy

Are there harmful side effects of marijuana? Yes, but no more so than any other drug including alcohol, tobacco, or caffiene. # Not addictive
If it was harmful, then why do so many intelligent people use it?. # Not addictive
The simple reason is: Alcohol and Tobacco.  How can Marijuana be illegal, if Alcohol (which is much more powerful on the mind and body) and Tobacco (which is much more addictive) can be purchased in any amount, at almost any place?. # Not addictive
Why does everyone push so hard for it, when all it does is make you high???. # Damages our bodies
Instead of relying on prescription drugs, marijuana helps with medical conditions concerning: Glaucoma, arthritis, cancer, pain, nausea, AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Brain Injury/Stroke, Anti-Tumor Effects, Asthma, Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Migraine, and eating disorders. It also helps with increased intelligence and focused attention. # Used as a medicine for its positive effects
No, I have seen people do stupid things under the influence of marijuana, like attempting to drive a car while blazed out of their minds. # Causes crime
Nobody has ever died directly related to marijuana. # Does not cause any damage to our bodies
What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. "Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness." So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, "depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy. # Responsible for brain damage
Some people like to use recreational drugs because it gives them a different perspective of things. # Used as a medicine for its positive effects
Marijuana also has proven to take a permanent toll on the adolescent brain. # Responsible for brain damage

It does not produce violence (exactly the opposite), it does not kill brain cells at all, and it does not make you insane. # Does not cause any damage to our bodies
The only study that proved anything about the relationship between marijuana and brain cells showed that it hinders the growth of cancers brain cells while leaving healthy ones alone. # Used as a medicine for its positive effects
Citizen-control is  not  a constitutional principle, in fact our rights insulate us from overt control by the government. # Prohibition violates human rights

You have no morals - because you're gay. # Gay people have problems and create social issues.
so since the BIBLE says it is not allowed then our Government shouldn't allow it? so what happened to the separation of church and state? the government is not supposed to support a particular religious view and therefore, to ban gay marriage because the BIBLE says it is not allowed, is a direct violation of the constitution. # Religion should not be used against gay rights.
it is wrong to be a homosexual. # Religion does not permit gay marriages.
Two people you don't know getting married doesn't effect you at all!. # Gay marriage is like any other marriage.
It is called human rights people!. # Gay people should have the same rights as straight people.
You can't argue that people or institutions are equal and then legally, and definitionally prohibit one group from participating in the rits of another group. That's not equal. If people are on equal ground, then segregating their practices and institutions contradicts that equity. If they are equal, then there's no reason at all to segregate. # Gay people should have the same rights as straight people.
Homosexuality breeds disease and moral corruption. # Gay people have problems and create social issues.
What is so hard to understand about separation of church and state? Our elected representatives need to check their theology at the door and uphold the law. # Religion should not be used against gay rights.
Gay people are always going to be gay. # People are born gay.
if you don't want to get pregnant why are you having sexual activity. # Be willing to have the baby if you have sex.
There is a difference between murder and being legally killed because of issues relating to self defense or for the greater good of society. # Abortion kills a life.
Whether or not this is true, I believe it preferrable to murder. # Abortion kills a life.
But by killing the fetus, you remove ANY chance at all. # Abortion kills a life.

A mother in the majority of causes is liable for the situation. She is undeniably creating human life(which is indeed distinct from human person) only to destroy it. # Be willing to have the baby if you have sex.
